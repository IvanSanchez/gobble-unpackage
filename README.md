# gobble-unpackage

Use only the needed files from NPM/SPM/CommonJS modules in your GobbleJS workflow.

## Why?

There are a myriad of javascript package managers our there: Bower, NPM, JSPM,
SPM, Volo, Meteor, Composer and so on.

The goal of `gobble-unpackage` is allowing you, the web developer, to use any
of these package managers, then use GobbleJS to filter out the files you need


## Installation

I assume you already know the basics of [Gobble](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble).

```bash
npm i -D gobble-unpackage
```

## Usage

In your `gobblefile`, run the `package` gobble transform, like so:

```javascript
var gobble = require( 'gobble' );
module.exports = gobble( directory_with_a_javascript_package ).transform( 'unpackage' );
```

The output node will contain only the files described by the `main` property of
the `package.json` file in the package. CSS and Less are managed, as well as
the SPM format for `package.json`.

If you want to override any values of the package's `package.json`, specify those
overrides as options to the 'unpackage' transform:

```js
module.exports = gobble( directory_with_a_javascript_package )
.transform( 'unpackage', { main: './build/foobar.js' });

```

## Example usage

A more ellaborate example, to concatenate some JS libraries:

```bash
npm install jquery
npm install bootstrap
npm install leaflet
```

```javascript
var gobble = require( 'gobble' );

var libs = gobble([
	gobble('node_modules/leaflet'  ).transform('unpackage'),
	gobble('node_modules/jquery'   ).transform('unpackage'),
	gobble('node_modules/bootstrap').transform('unpackage', {
		main: './dist/js/bootstrap.js'
	})
]);

var libJS = libs.transform('concat', { dest: 'libs.js', files: '**/*.js' });
var libCSS = libs.transform('concat', { dest: 'libs.css', files: '**/*.css' });

module.exports = gobble([ libJS, libCSS ]);
```


## Caveats

`gobble-unpackage` will **not**:

* resolve `require()` calls as some CommonJS modules expect
* process packages which do not include `.js` in the filename of for the `main` property
